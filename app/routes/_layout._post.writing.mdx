{/* Goals
1. Get better at writing
2. Teach others (give back) */}

Twitter. Instagram. LinkedIn. All places for us to create a story about ourselves, interact
with other people, and get blasted by ads. Social media has proven to be a reliable way to
share ideas, grow an audience, and influence others at scale; it's also shown itself to be
quite addictive, the constant need to stay engaged with certain people or The Current Thing.
Despite the drawbacks, there's enough good stuff that comes out of this current format that
we keep using it. But back before the platforms ruled the internet, people could still express
themselves and communicate their thoughts with others, through forms such as chat rooms, forums,
and the humble blog.

<br />

While social media shines particularly well in short-form remarks, it falls apart when nuance or
detail are required. Sure, you can write a long post or create a thread, but it's not really in
the spirit of the medium (and many people won't even bother to stop and read your wall of text,
lest they miss their next hit of dopamine). When folks want to share a complex idea or explain
the subtleties of a topic, they often bail out of the short-form medium into something more long-form;
often, some sort of blog. Now, maybe that blog exists on another platform, like Substack or medium;
but, especially in development circle, you may find yourself on what might be described as the
opposite of a platform — a bespoke, custom-crafted website. That's where you are right now in fact.

<br />

But why?

<br />

Why build my own hand-rolled website just to do what I can already do on <i>a platform</i> with ease?
I'm sure for many the answer is clear — it's the autonomy to do what I want; to create an experience
that is reflective of myself, not a company or a platform. There are no preconceived notions here,
it's a unique experience because it is my own. It's a place for stories, <i>my</i> stories.

<br />

So what, is this a vanity project then? I mean, to some degree, yes, but vanity for vanity's sake is
meaningless. No, my vision for this space is two-fold. First is to be able to give back what I know;
what I mean by that is I have come to know so much of what I know as a developer by reading other
developer's blogs. I am constantly reading, pouring knowledge into my head, with my only outlet being
my job. Most of the time this is plenty, given I tend to take my learnings and apply them to what
I'm working on, but sometimes I can't for one reason or another. So this is another space for me to
pour out, but to a larger audience and with less boundaries. My second aim with this space is to work
on my writing skills. I wouldn't consider myself a writer by any stretch, but it's a valuable skill
useful for anything from writing detailed technical documentation to composing song lyrics.

<br />

That's it; maybe those goals change, maybe they grow, maybe they stay exactly the same. All I know is that I am
excited to stretch my brain in new ways, to be free from the platforms and their algorithms, and to
hopefully share some ideas that are worth stopping for.
