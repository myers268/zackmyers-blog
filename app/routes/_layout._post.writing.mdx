Twitter. Instagram. LinkedIn. All places for us to create a story about ourselves, interact with other people, and get blasted by ads. Social media has proven to be a reliable way to share ideas, grow an audience, and influence others at scale; it's also shown itself to be quite addictive, the constant need to stay engaged with certain people or The Current Thing. Despite the drawbacks, we continue to latch on to the good parts of this current format enough to us keep it vibrant and alive. But back before the platforms ruled the internet, people could still express themselves and communicate their thoughts with others on the internet through other formats such as chat rooms, forums, and the humble blog.

<br />

While social media shines particularly well in short-form content, it falls apart when nuance or detail are required. Sure, you can write a long post or create a thread, but it's not really in the spirit of the medium (and many people won't even bother to stop and read your wall of text, lest they miss their next hit of dopamine). When folks want to share a complex idea or explain the subtleties of a topic, they often bail out of the short-form medium into something more long-form; often, by one name or another, a blog. Maybe that blog exists on another platform, like Substack or Medium; but, especially in development circles, you may find yourself on what might be described as the opposite of a platform — a bespoke, custom-crafted website. That's where you are right now in fact.

<br />

But why?

<br />

Why build my own hand-rolled website just to do what I can already do on <i>a platform</i> with ease? Why not use a platform, where the nitty gritty details have been smoothed out, leaving a polished experience to author my thoughts? The answer is simple — I don't want a finished experience, <i>I want to build the experience</i>. I want a space that is reflective of me, somehwere I can play and craft everything to my designs. I don't want a pre-fab home, I want to draw up the blueprints, gather the materials, and build it myself.

<br />

So what, is this a vanity project then? I mean, to some degree, yes, but vanity for vanity's sake is meaningless. No, my vision for this space is more than vanity. My first hope is to be able to give back to the web development community, whom I have reaped the rewards of learning from. I am regularly reading the blogs of other developers, pouring knowledge into my head, which is in turn poured out into my career. Why stop the river of knowledge there though? I can be more than a consumer of information; I have my own thoughts and ideas to share. As others' words have helped guide my path, I hope my words can help guide yet more. To that end, this blog is largely intended for writing on web development and other software engineering topics, but that isn't to say I won't stray to and fro from time to time. This brings me to my second aim, which is to have a space to work on my writing. I'm not always great at using my words, straining for the right terms and trying to put them in proper order. There is value in being able to clearly express what's in our heads, whether that be technical documentation or lyrics to a song; this is a place for me to spill out the contents of my head and toil away to put it all in order — not just for others, but also for myself.

<br />

That's it really; maybe those goals change, maybe they grow, maybe they stay exactly the same. All I know is that I am excited to stretch my brain in new ways, to be free to build my own world, and to hopefully put out some thoughts that are worth sharing.
